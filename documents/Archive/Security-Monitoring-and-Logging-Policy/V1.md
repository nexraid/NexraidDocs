# Nexraid Security Monitoring and Logging Policy
## Introduction
This Policy describes the actions to be taken to perform system and infrastructure log reviews for security purposes within the company. Effective review of log data is often the most challenging aspect of security management, but is also usually one of the most important. Inadequacies in logging and monitoring may result in violations being undetected, or insufficient or inaccurate evidence being available to invoke an appropriate, timely and comprehensive response.


## Scope of Document
This policy covers the regular and systematic review of all relevant security monitoring systems belonging to or managed by the company. Some systems, networks and environments have historically been designed and implemented in a way that makes them difficult to adapt to changes in conditions, processes, and procedures. These systems may even be mission- critical to the company. While this policy will apply to these systems, exception processes and procedures may be created where a business requirement is identified for them. All future system and network implementations are to take this policy into consideration during the design and development stage.


## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide high-level directives so that standards and procedures can be produced to meet the company’s requirements for security logging and monitoring of critical systems and infrastructure.


## Security Monitoring
1. Reviews of access control systems records and logs for all corporate systems, i.e. firewalls, routers, IDS/IPS, DB and web servers shall be undertaken at least daily; Where SEIM is employed this will constantly monitor to filter alerts and notifications but the resulting output must be reviewed at least once daily;
2. All unexplained access or attempted access, whether physical or logical shall be investigated in compliance with the Incident Response Policy;
3. All active and passive monitoring activities conducted within corporate premises and systems shall be authorised by the Head of Group Information Security through the Risk Committee;
4. Activity logs of all attempts (successful or failed) to physically enter the corporate premises or logically access the IT infrastructure including any network, system or application whether through direct or remote access shall be subject to regular auditing and monitoring;
5. Security logging data is required to be held in a central repository;
6. Central time servers governed by a reputable public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server must be employed, using the latest version, for accurate log timestamps to increase the non-repudiation of a security event;
7. A corporate standard for the deployment of active intrusion detection and or prevention systems shall be defined and implemented to monitor suspicious activity. As a minimum, active intrusion detection mechanisms shall be deployed on network perimeter devices;
8. Communications both internal and external of the corporate systems shall be monitored to uphold corporate policies and standards;
9. Transfer of data relating to employee communications in respect of rights and privacy shall be undertaken with consideration for legislation in accordance with the Acceptable Usage Policy.
10. Monitoring of customer and third party communications shall be undertaken in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the lawful interception of communications, i.e. Computer Misuse Act 2007;
11. Logging of employee or customer personal data shall be undertaken in accordance with corporate policy that takes into consideration the requirements and provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.


## Audit Logs
1. Audit logs recording user activities, exceptions, and information security events shall be produced and retained to assist investigations and access control monitoring.
2. The following data shall be recorded where permissible:
   1. User IDs
   2. Dates, times and details of key events, i.e. log-on, log-off
   3. Terminal identity or location
   4. Records of successful and rejected system access attempts
   5. Records of successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts
   6. Changes to system configurations
   7. Use of privileges
   8. Use of system utilities and applications
   9. Files access and the kind of access
   10. Alarms raised by access control systems 
   11. Activation or deactivation of protection systems, i.e. anti-virus, intrusion detection / prevention systems.
3. System administrator and operator activities shall be logged, including:
   1. The time at which an event occurred
   2. Whether the event was a success or failure
   3. Information about the event
   4. Which account and which administrator undertook the task
   5. Which process was invoked
4. Sufficient information shall be retained (at a minimum) to establish:
   1. When (date and time) an event occurred;
   2. Where the event occurred;
   3. The outcome (success or failure) of the event; and
   4. The identity of the user/subject associated with the event.
5. Information systems shall be protected from and monitored to detect information leakage. Processes shall be implemented to respond to any leakage by:
   1. Raising alerts to designated personnel using a secure method of communication;
   2. Identifying the cause of the information leakage and the type and quantity of data ‘At Risk’;
   3. Enabling the isolation of information systems that are leaking data;
   4. Facilitating the eradication of information from any contaminated systems;
   5. Identifying any other information or information systems that may have been contaminated subsequently.
6. Audit logs shall be:
   1. protected against tampering and unauthorised access, or from being deactivated, modified or deleted;
   2. encrypted in accordance with the Data Retention and Archive and Cryptography and Encryption policies;
   3. backed-up and archived in accordance with the Back-Up Policy, and retained such that a minimum of three months’ history can be provided for immediate analysis, with a further provision of a year’s records held in archive.


## Log Review Cycle
1. Surveillance security logs shall be subject to reviews that are supplemented by daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly checks aimed to detect and deter recognised patterns of potential intrusions and incursions and that will initiate designated response actions, up to and including the invocation of the Incident Response Policy.
2. The logs of systems holding Business Sensitive data, providing connectivity to hosts or networks holding such data, or any system facing the Internet must be reviewed daily;
3. The logs of other systems, those holding non-sensitive data shall be reviewed weekly;
4. The logs of holding non-sensitive Public data should be reviewed fortnightly;
5. Only appropriately authorised persons within the company, or specifically contracted third parties, shall review security log files.


## Responding to Events
1. Logging records shall be made available in a timely manner if an investigation requires the production of such records;
2. When a log review identifies a possible security incident as defined in the Information Security Incident Management Policy it must be reported in accordance with the policy;
3. Log reviewers are likely to be tasked to review logs out-of-cycle and to a greater degree of scrutiny during an incident, they are also likely to be required to provide copies of the logs, with an explanation of findings to the Incident Response Team;
4. Refer to the Security Incident Management Policy for escalation and reporting of events through the proper channels, and make sure that appropriate actions are taken to safeguard data and to accurately record events / actions taken;
5. Faults are to be logged, analysed and appropriate action taken against them – this includes reports made by users or system programs;
6. A log review is to be conducted to verify that all events have been resolved;
7. Corrective actions are to be recorded to make certain that controls have not been compromised and that the action taken is authorised.


## Log Infrastructure Monitoring
The log reviewer should monitor the log output to make certain that:
1. The status of all log sources is to be enabled, configured properly, and functioning as expected;
2. Log rotation and archival processes shall be developed and implemented so that logs are archived and cleared correctly and older logs are destroyed once they are no longer needed – in accordance with the Data Retention and Archive Policy;
3. Log rotation monitoring shall include regular checks through automated or manual means of the remaining space available for logs. When logs reach a defined threshold (i.e. 85 per cent) a notification shall be sent to the console in order that appropriate provision to make more space available can be taken;
4. Each system’s clock is synchronised to a common time source so that its timestamps will match those generated by other systems;
5. Reconfigure logging as needed based on factors such as policy changes, audit findings, technology changes, and new security needs;
6. Maintain a record of all changes made to the log monitoring systems;
7. Detection and documentation of anomalies in log settings, configurations, and processes is to be maintained; such anomalies may indicate malicious activity, deviations from policy and procedures, and flaws in logging mechanisms. Any anomalies are to be reported in accordance with the Information Security Incident Management Policy;
8. Logging facilities and information shall be protected against tampering and unauthorised access;
9. An alert shall be produced and disseminated in the event of an audit processing failure. This is to be treated as an incident and immediate actions taken to restore logging capabilities.


## Supporting Documentation
1. Appropriate documentation in support of systems that log and monitor activities on networks and systems shall be maintained at all times, and shall:
1. define maintenance, security features and functions;
2. be afforded protection from unauthorised access and manipulation;
3. be updated where appropriate as part of Change Management processes such that it accurately reflects the current live/production systems;
4. define the department (or job title) with responsibility for maintaining it;
5. contains appropriate document controls, i.e. Title, Version and date.


## Fault Logs
1. Access control systems records and logging system fault logs shall be retained, analysed by an appropriately qualified person who is to verify that appropriate action is taken, which can result in Change Management requests or escalation to the Incident Response Team (IRT) for further investigation and action.
2. The fault logs shall help facilitate:
   1. The identification and reporting of potential business impacts that might result from known (or possible) information systems, application or process flaws;
   2. identifying vulnerabilities in security software or firmware updates;
   3. verifying the effectiveness of software and/or firmware updates.


## Responsibilities
1. A breach of this Policy will be treated as an incident and investigated as appropriate.
2. Regular reviews of logging and monitoring systems must be undertaken by system owners to confirm that this Policy is adhered to, that the systems are functioning as intended and are appropriate for business needs. A record of such activity is to be maintained.
