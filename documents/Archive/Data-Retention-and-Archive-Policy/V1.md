# Nexraid Data Retention and Archive Policy
## Introduction 
Corporate systems, databases, electronic records and hard copy files contain information which is an invaluable business asset. Having accurate and relevant information is vital to the efficient management of the company which needs to balance its statutory obligations and the desire to be open and responsive with the duty to safeguard the confidentiality of business sensitive records.

The company will create and manage all records efficiently, making them accessible to authorised personnel when required for business purposes whilst protecting them from unauthorised access.

In addition to business operational use, information records serve as evidence of business activities, contracts and communications; some of the data retention periods result from statutory compliance, legal requirements, industry regulations or business mandates.

Data retention requirements govern the storage of information, records, and data; the specific periods, for which they must be retained, the media storage format used to store specific data types; and recognised disposal methodologies to be applied once the retention period expires.


## Scope of Document
This policy applies to all information assets owned by NexRaid whereby information is held electronically or where the same data is held in hard copy format. The policy applies to all temporary and permanent copies, including back-up and archive copies, of information to a level that is consistent with the classification and risks associated with that information. Items that constitute records include, but are not limited to:
* Documents (including hand-written, typed, and annotated copies)
* Paper based files
* Computer files (including word processed documents, databases, spreadsheets and presentations, backup and archive storage media)
* Maps and plans
