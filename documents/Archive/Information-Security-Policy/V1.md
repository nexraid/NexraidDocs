## Information Protection
Information is an invaluable business asset. By its very nature some information processed, stored and transmitted internally and externally of Nexraid is sensitive and consequently requires suitable protection to safeguard it from unauthorised access, manipulation, disclosure or destruction.

2. The appropriate method of handling and storing the information is identified and applied;
3. Employees are aware of different sensitivity levels and can apply appropriate controls to the information they process in the course of their business activities
4. Information is retained, handled and processed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, Directives, policies and business operational requirements.

1. The appropriate level of sensitivity of information is recognised;
2. The appropriate method of handling and storing the information is identified and applied;
3. Employees are aware of different sensitivity levels and can apply appropriate controls to the information they process in the course of their business activities
4. Information is retained, handled and processed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, Directives, policies and business operational requirements.

* Secret – information that requires highest level of protection and confidentiality

* Protected – information that requires sufficient level of protection to prevent its unauthorised access and use;
* Internal – information intended for use within Nexraid, and its appropriately authorised business partners;
