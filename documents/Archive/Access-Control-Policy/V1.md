# Nexraid Access Control Policy
## Introduction
Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd (Nexraid) handles quantities of sensitive information relating to its customers, its staff and its own business operations. This information may be accessible in several ways; both electronically and in hardcopy format.

## Scope of Document
* This policy applies to all 'Users' who have a legitimate business requirement to access the data and information systems owned or controlled by the company in support of its business operations.
* This policy covers all stages of the lifecycle for user access controls, from initial registration through to changes in role, deregistration and revocation of access.
* The controls may equally apply to third party suppliers providing services on behalf of the company.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide direction for the implementation of appropriate technical controls to protect access to information assets and the information contained therein.

# Policy Statements
Requests for access to corporate information systems and data contained therein are to be appropriately authorised and subject to identification and authentication controls which must be completed before access is permitted. Access is denied by default, unless a specific, valid and authorised request for access has been processed.

## Access to Information Systems
1. Individual access to premises, systems, services or information shall be determined on a Need-to-Know, and least privilege basis in accordance with business requirements based on an individual's job role and function;
2. Access controls and security requirements must be addressed for internal users, suppliers and customers before granting access to information or the information assets;
3. Each business system and/or application run by, or on behalf of, the company shall have a nominated Business Owner and/or System Administrator responsible for managing and controlling access to the system, application and the associated information (data) contained therein;
4. Access rights shall be controlled (where practical/possible) to restrict a users' abilities according to business needs and function, i.e. read, write, delete, execute, print, etc.;
5. Access control requirements shall be clearly defined, documented and maintained within an access matrix which specifies the rights of individuals or groups of users;
6. System settings for access controls shall be configured to 'deny all' unless specific authorisation controls are implemented to permit access;
7. During the authentication process response information shall be obscured to prevent it being used for possible exploitation or use by unauthorised persons;
8. Access to corporate assets, both physical and logical, shall be controlled through a formal registration and de-registration procedure for granting and revoking access based on business needs and security requirements ensuring that:
   1. Each 'User' is identified by a unique identity (User ID), enabling them to be linked to and thereby accountable and responsible for the actions performed with that User ID;
   2. User IDs must not be shared with any other person irrespective of their role and position within the company;
   3. Concurrent use of the same User ID shall be prohibited within corporate systems;
   4. The reuse of user or device identities shall be prohibited.
9. 'User' access rights shall be reviewed quarterly as a minimum to positively confirm they are aligned to business requirements.
10. Group and shared IDs, passwords or other authentication methods are explicitly prohibited.

## Creation, Termination, Modification or Revocation of Access
1. Line Managers/Business Owners are to authorise the creation, or modification of 'User' access based on a specific job requirement and job specification;
2. Subsequent to the authorisation process being completed Systems Administrator(s) will only assign access to the extent approved;
3. 'Users' are to be made aware of their responsibilities for the protection of information and acknowledge this requirement â€“ in accordance with the Acceptable Use Policy;
4. The identity of all 'Users' shall be verified and confirmed before user access controls are set/reset and/or unlocked;
5. Access is granted only after authorisation is obtained;
6. Access rights, for users including external third party personnel shall be revoked within 24 hours of the individual changing or leaving company employment or ceasing to require access to a specific system, application or data;
7. Where a user 'Transfers' to another department/role within the business, the receiving Department/Line Manager is to authorise any new access requirements and use of corporate assets. Where practical and possible access requirements pertinent to the 'old' role are to be revoked; this is a responsibility of the ex-Line Manager;
8. Terminated accounts are to be disabled within 24 hours and removed within 90 days;
9. Monitoring and management of redundant user accounts shall take place at least quarterly.

## Access to Special Privileges
1. Special attention shall be given, where appropriate, to control the allocation of privileged access rights, which allows systems administrators or developers to override system controls;
2. All access to high level privileges (i.e. Domain Administrator in Windows operating systems, root in Unix/Linux) shall be controlled using a formally documented procedure, and access to the passwords for these accounts will be monitored;
3. Access to administrative accounts shall only be provided to the minimum number of individuals and reviewed quarterly by the IT Department;
4. Where appropriate, privileged accounts shall be assigned to a different User ID from those used for normal business use and a log of increased user privileges shall be recorded;
5. Privileged account users shall access systems via the use of strong passwords / authentication mechanisms in excess of the rules defined for normal 'Users' contained in the Acceptable Use Policy (Administrative passwords shall be complex, at least 10 characters, or employ a two-factor authentication mechanism/biometric);
6. Remote access to corporate systems for the purposes of maintaining information technology systems and infrastructure must incorporate a two-factor authentication mechanism;
7. Remote access by third party personnel to any corporate system must incorporate a two-factor authentication mechanism;
8. Personnel with special privileges are not authorised to use their administrative access to setup new user accounts, or amend existing accounts, outside the formal documented processes for account creation and modification;
9. All elevation, changes, additions or deletions to any account with Root or Administrative Privileges is to be logged and an auditable event/trail retained.

## Authentication and Password Management
1. Passwordless and Biometrics authentications systems, such as FIDO2, remains as the preferred authentication mechanisms. It should be used for authentication whenever the solutions/systems support such features. 
2. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), where 2 or more factors of authentication, such as biometrics and password, must be used whenever the systems/solutions support such capabilities.
3. Passwords used to access information assets shall conform to the company policy and business requirements relating to password composition, length, expiration and confidentiality.
4. The password management process/system shall make sure that passwords:
   1. are at least twelve(12) characters long;
	 2. contain a combination of letters (upper and lower case), a numeric and where possible a special character (symbol);
	 3. are required to be changed on first use and a maximum of every 365-days thereafter;
	 4. can only be changed after successful authentication by the account owner;
	 5. shall not be the same as at least the last four previously used;
	 6. are not displayed in clear text when being entered;
	 7. are only stored in an encrypted form;
	 8. are not recorded in audit trails;
	 9. are to be re-entered to unlock inactive accounts after a period of 15 minutes or less.
5. Additionally:
	 1. accounts will be locked-out after a maximum of five(5) invalid logon attempts;
	 2. account lockout shall be set to a minimum of 30 minutes or until an administrator has actively reactivated the users' account;
	 3. system administrator passwords are to comprise a minimum of 12 characters and must employ complexity rules as defined above or utilise two-factor authentication mechanisms.
	 4. system administrators performing non-console access to the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) must do so using  Multi Factor Authentication (MFA).

## Default Access Control
1. Access controls to systems, applications or utility programs configured and applied by vendors or system administrators must be changed from their default settings or the accounts disabled before the systems become operational in a production environment.
2. Use of any default access controls must be restricted, tightly controlled, monitored and audited.

## Access Control Mechanisms
1. Remote access, and some high privilege access, will require the use of additional access control mechanisms to facilitate identification of authorised Responsible Persons. Such mechanisms may include but are not limited to, Tokens, Smart Cards, Key-fobs or biometrics.
2. Users may not share such mechanisms with any other person and shall not leave the access control mechanism unattended where it can be obtained or used by unauthorised persons.
3. Access control mechanisms shall be handed back and revoked when no longer required for use, which may be a result of the individual:
   1. leaving the company employment
   2. changing job role and functionality
   3. no longer requiring access to a particular system.

## Third Party Access
Refer to the [Third-Party Suppliers Policy](Third-Party-Suppliers-Policy.md "Third-Party Suppliers Policy").

## Audits
1. Access rights shall be reviewed by the information owner (with the assistance of IT) at a frequency consistent with the business risks but on an annual basis as a minimum.
2. Reviews to identify inactive accounts in excess of 90 days are to be conducted to verify if they are required for further use; if not they are to be revoked.
3. Comparisons and verifications are to be made at least quarterly against personnel who have changed roles internally, or who have left the company to confirm that appropriate adjustments and revocations of their access rights to their account/access profiles have been conducted. Any anomalies are to be investigated and corrective action taken where appropriate.

## System Monitoring
Information systems deemed critical by the information owner shall be monitored. The level and type of monitoring required for individual systems and facilities shall be determined by an information security risk assessment and will be in accordance with the Security Logging and Monitoring Policy.

## Breach of Policy
1. Any User who is aware of, or suspects, a breach of this policy is to report the circumstances and specifics of the event as known by them to [Information Security Manager](Roles-and-Responsibilities.md#information-security-manager-ism "Information Security Manager"), their Line Manager or [Human Resource Manager](Roles-and-Responsibilities.md#human-resource-manager-hrm "Human Resource Manager").
2. All reported instances will be investigated in accordance with the Information Security Incident Management Policy and as a consequence of the findings of an investigation where wrong doing has been proven disciplinary actions may be taken in accordance with the disciplinary policy.
