### Existing Measures and Processes
* Were audits regularly conducted on both physical and IT-related security measures? Were the action items from the audits remediated?
* Are there processes that can be streamlined or introduced to limit the damage if future data breaches happen or to prevent a relapse?
* Were there weaknesses in existing security measures (e.g., use of outdated software and protection measures such as weak passwords)?
* Were there weaknesses in the use of portable storage devices or connectivity to the Internet?
* Were the methods for accessing and transmitting personal data sufficiently secure (e.g., access only limited to authorised personnel)?
