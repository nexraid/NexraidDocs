## Responsibility and Roles

### Head of Department (HOD)
If not otherwise waived, the HOD supports and oversees the risk management related to department’s critical assets including Personal Identifiable Information (PII). The HOD is by default the risk owner of all risk associated directly to the respective department. He also ensures that risks related to assets supporting his operations are effectively managed.

### Head of IT
Has the responsibility to oversee risk as management related to supporting ICT assets including Personal Identifiable Information (PII) taken in considerations needs of the HOD.

### Management Representative (MR)
Oversees and coordinate the over risk management process; including risk assessment; risk treatments and evaluation of effectiveness of the programs and ensures that risk management processes are aligned with applicable requirements defined in ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 27701 and specified in SLAs, inclusive of any laws and regulations.

> Critical asset is either a supporting asset or a primary asset, see the definition.

> Need to distinguish the cost of replacing an asset if lost or damaged from the value of an asset by its function. For example, a firewall might have a replacement value of 1000 USD; but if not functioning the impact might be much bigger than 1000 USD.

The process closely follows the recommended risk assessment process flow of ISO 31000, reproduced below:

## Procedure
### Conducting Risk Assessments
* Risk assessments can be conducted by various means in diverse context. The scope of a particular risk assessment might be restricted to specific areas like product/software design, process design or ICT infrastructure issues. 
* It is the responsibility of management to allocate sufficient resources for an effective risk assessment and treatment.

### Ad-hoc Informal High-level and Formal Detail Assessments
* Information security risk assessment can be ad-hoc informal at all times or formally planned. Ad-hoc risk assessments may take place at any time and might be part of any business meetings or process. Ad-hoc informal assessments might complement formal assessments. Results of ad-hoc risk assessment shall be communicated to the MR.
* Information security risk assessment might follow a more general business impact assessment conducted in the context of company’s business continuity planning.
* The MR is responsible to aggregate risk assessment results and to ensure that identified risks are tracked and mitigated as expected.
* A formal risk assessment process is based on the process defined in this procedure and managed in compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27701:2019 requirements.

### Risk Assessment Criteria
* Risk evaluation criteria guides the company in conducting risk assessments.
* Risk evaluation criteria are defined in order to identify, evaluate, treat and accept information security risks related to operations, service, product design, production process and design of software and firmware. Risk assessment criteria might change depending on a changing business environment in which the company operates.
* Risk assessment criteria include:
   * Criteria for performing risk assessment
   * Risk evaluation criteria
   * Impact criteria
   * Risk acceptance criteria
* Identifying and communicating risk assessment criteria and ensures that they are understood by all participants of a risk assessment process. 

### Criteria for Performing Risk Assessment
A formal risk assessment will be performed at least once a year. The following event shall be considered for conducting risk assessments.
* New customers
* Near misses
* Significant changes in technology
* Changes under control of a formal change management process
* Preparing SLA
* Changes in legal requirements
* Changes to senior leadership team
* Merger and acquisitions
* Emerging ITC threats

### Risk evaluation criteria include:
* The strategic value of business information and IP
* The criticality of information assets used by the company
* Contractual obligations, legal and regulatory requirements related services and products
* Operational and business importance of availability, confidentiality and integrity of assets and products
* Stakeholder’s expectations and perceptions, and negative consequences for goodwill and reputation in case of any security breach or incident related to products and processes. Special attention shall be given to utilities’ requirements and expectation

Each HOD is responsible to identify and communicate additional risk evaluation criteria internally.

### Impact Criteria
Impact criteria are specified in terms of the degree of damage or cost caused by an information security event (processes, product, infrastructure).

This includes risks of 
* Production loss
* Financial loss
* Level of classification of the impacted information asset, if classified
* Breaches of information security (e.g., loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability)
* Impaired operations (internal or third parties)
* Loss of business and financial value
* Disruption of plans and deadlines, IP loss
* Damage of reputation
* Breaches of legal, regulatory or contractual requirements

### Risk Acceptance Criteria
* Acceptance of residual risks (risk remaining after treatment or existing under consideration of current controls in place) is based on decisions of owner of assets in the scope of the assessment. Acceptance of any risk, which might affect the overall business of the company shall be reviewed and evaluated in cooperation with the MR.
* Acceptance of risks related to risks related to contractual and legal requirements shall be reviewed by top management and signed-off by senior management 

### Defining Asset Types
In order to identify and manage assets, there are two kinds of assets (primary and secondary) and are categorized in the following:

| Asset type                              | Kind       | Remark / Example                                                                                                                               |

### Evaluation Value of Assets
* Asset values are based on the potential impact, which an incident might have on the overall operation of the company as well as on replacement cost of the asset.
* An asset value might be revised after the risk analysis.
* Each asset can be assigned with two scores between 1 and 5.
    * One score is representing the replacement value of the asset and is based on a monetary value;
    * the other score represents a non-monetary (or a value difficult to express in monetary units) and must be seen in context with the system in which it is used and its criticality.
* Assigning an asset value shall take in account all stakeholders.
* There can be different asset values assigned by different stakeholders.


### Valuation of Information Security Assets
* Values of information assets should be characterized in terms of its protection properties:
    * Confidentiality
    * Integrity
    * Availability
    * Regulatory
* The protection properties and rating are indicated in the critical asset register and taken into account during risk identification and overall risk assessment in forming the risk register.
* Asset register with Protection Properties:
    * The value and sensitivity of an information asset can be also evaluated in terms of the worst-case scenarios that could be reasonably expected to happen from adverse business consequences due to unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized modification, non-availability for varying time periods, destruction, loss of confidentiality, integrity, availability and affecting regulatory requirements.

#### Monetary & Non-Monetary Evaluation

## Identification of Vulnerabilities
There are different categories of vulnerabilities to be considered. Vulnerabilities can be classified in the following category of weakness:
* Organization and policy
* Dependence on external party
* Processes and procedures
* Management routines
* Personnel
* Physical environment
* Information system configuration
* Hardware
* Software
* Coding vulnerability
* Communications equipment

### Identification of Technical Vulnerabilities
Technical vulnerability shall be evaluated based on publicly available sources for vulnerability information. These include but are not limited to:
1. “Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)” Top 10 Vulnerabilities for web application design
    * https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page
2. CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors
3. National Vulnerability Database Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities
    * http://nvd.nist.gov/cwe.cfm

IT manager is responsible to get up-to-date information about vulnerabilities relevant for supporting IT assets.

### Vulnerabilities in Software, Firmware and Related Services
* Specific attention shall be given to vulnerabilities in software design.
* It is the responsibility of the manager of the respective department to ensure that vulnerabilities are timely identified and addressed.
* Vulnerabilities shall be evaluated with reference to current controls.
* Each department manager is responsible to identify vulnerabilities and to maintain a register of vulnerabilities of its primary assets.
* IT department maintains a register of vulnerabilities of supporting IT assets.
* Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (ISO/IEC 27002:2013) shall be utilized during the risk assessment process in order to identify further threats and vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerabilities in Current Controls
* After identification of threats, existing controls to counter these threats shall be identified and documented.
* Controls can vary from technical measure to awareness measures. An existing procedure might be a control, documented or not.
* The need of documenting of controls depends on the complexity of tasks involved.
* Depending on the scope of the risk assessment, different types of vulnerabilities are identified. Vulnerabilities are identified with reference to diverse sources.

## Identification of Threats
* Considering of an incident scenario might help to identify threats and vulnerabilities. Such scenarios shall be documented.
* Depending on the scope of the risk assessment, different types of threats shall be considered. Under guidance of the chairman threats to assets and threat sources are identified. Threats can be of different nature: environmental, accidental, and malicious.
* Threats might relate to:
   * Critical infrastructure requirements in the target market
   * General information security
   * Others, which might relate indirectly to information security. E.g., threat of fire due to wrong device configuration
* Diagram in the Annex might be used to identify threats. If needed, it should be amended accordingly.
* Each department manager is responsible to maintain a register of threats applicable to its primary assets.
* IT maintains a register of all threats to supporting IT assets

## Ensuring Security Risk Assessments Produce Consistent, Valid and Comparable Results 
Consistency, validity and comparability of risk assessment result are reviewed at least during internal audits and after each incident or near miss.

### Setting Risk Management Objectives
The results of risk assessments are prioritized, and related risk management objectives determined

### Risk Treatment Planning
Once priorities for risk treatments have been decided appropriate risk treatment plans has to be established.

## Glossary - Definitions/Abbreviations
If not otherwise defined the following terms are binding.

### Asset:
* Any information, service, system, device, process that has value to the company or its stakeholder and which needs protection in terms of confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity and reliability. 
* Assets are of two kinds: **Primary Assets** and **Supporting Assets**. 
   * Primary Assets are assets like business processes and information directly creating value for the organization;
   * Supporting Assets are assets on which primary assets rely on or assets which are used to protect primary assets.

   
### Asset Owner / Asset Stakeholder:
Identifies a role, individual or business unit that has approved management responsibility for controlling the production, development, maintenance, use and security of assets. The term ’owner’ does not mean that the person actually has any property rights to the asset. Any entity is called a stakeholder if it has specific interest in the asset. E.g., expectations in protection of confidentiality (a utility, consumer using smart meters). An owner is a specific type of stakeholder.

### Consequence:
Outcome of an event affecting security and finally achievement of business objectives.

### Risk:
Effect of uncertainty on information security or on business objectives of the company and its stakeholders. Information security risk is expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an information security event and the associated likelihood of occurrence. Information security risk is associated with the potential that threats will exploit vulnerabilities of an information asset and thereby cause harm to an organization.

### Residual Risk:
Risk remaining after risk treatment

### Risk Owner:
Person or entity with the accountability and authority to manage a risk

### Risk Assessment:
Overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation

### Risk Identification:
Process of finding, recognizing and describing risks. Risk identification also involves the identification of risk sources, events, their causes and their potential consequences; it can involve historical data, theoretical analysis, informed and expert opinions, and stakeholders’ needs.

### Risk Analysis:
Process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level of risk. Risk analysis also provides the basis for risk evaluation and decisions about risk treatment.

### Risk Evaluation:
Process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude are acceptable or tolerable.

### Risk Treatment:
Process to modify risk. Avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the risk; taking or increasing risk in order to pursue an opportunity; removing the risk source; changing the likelihood; changing the consequences; sharing the risk with another party or parties (including contracts and risk financing); and retaining the risk by informed choice.

### Threat:
Potential cause of an incident, which may result in harm to the company’s product. IT systems or the organization

### Vulnerability:
Weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by a threat
