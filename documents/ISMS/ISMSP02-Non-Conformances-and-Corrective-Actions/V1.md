## Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) Failures
1. It is the duty of all members (including employees, contractors, interns, business partners and visitors) on site to immediately report the following ISMS failures to the Management Representative:
    1. Information security incidents and emergency situations
    2. Information security near misses or weaknesses
    3. ISMS breaches
    4. Non-conformance to ISMS policy/procedures
2. Non-conformances may relate to procedures, equipment or personnel. Indicators to facilitate the recognition of these failures include:
    1. Trend analysis from past incidents
    2. Updates from Risk Assessment
    3. Inspection reports
3. Management Representative is to record all failures in the Corrective Action Report (CAR) in Annex A. An investigation into the root cause of the non-conformance is to be conducted by the Management Representative in consultation with any staff involved in the operation/area. Thereafter, corrective actions are to be drawn up in consultation with any staff involved in the operation/area. Where necessary this should trigger or feed into the input of the ISMS for review.
4. Following completion of the action, the Management Representative will implement and record any changes in the documented procedures resulting from corrective action and will include the required training where necessary.

## Reporting
The ISMS Steering Committee is to review all ISMS related failures, incidents, nonconformances and corrective action as part of their management review meeting or operational review meeting agenda.
