7. Ensure appropriate controls are applied by all Users to the physical security of those assets on a day-to-day basis and as directed by Risk Assessment;
8. Secure any physical asset containing corporate or client business sensitive data which may be used in publicly accessible areas with an appropriate antitheft device, whilst employing active authentication and logon controls;
9. Position information systems to minimise potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimise the opportunity for unauthorised access;
