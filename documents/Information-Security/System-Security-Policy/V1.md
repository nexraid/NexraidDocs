# Nexraid System Security Policy
## Introduction
The data stored, processed or transmitted from or within NexRaid Consulting Pte Ltd (NexRaid) corporate systems is one of its most valuable assets. The majority of corporate and client data is processed via information technology systems and as such controls surrounding their use are integral to ensuring the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of all such data contained therein. All systems must be installed, configured, administered and maintained to the highest security levels as dictated by industry security best practices to safeguard against accidental or malicious loss, damage, theft, unauthorised access or destruction.


## Scope of Document
The scope of this policy covers all computer systems connected to corporate networks (whether directly or remotely connected) as well as stand-alone computer workstations owned or leased by the company and used by its employees in the course of their business functions;


## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define high-level principles on the engineering, use, deployment and maintenance of information systems with the intention that they shall:
1. Employ the correct standards, processes and procedures as defined by the company;
2. Facilitate maintenance of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of information stored, processed and/or transmitted through corporate IT systems;
3. Define the minimum systems requirements to be implemented or adhered to when deploying or managing IT systems within corporate networks;
4. Include sunset dates for operating system platform replacement;
5. Verify systems configuration requirements and specifications are designed and implemented explicitly for information systems based on risk assessment and in accordance with relevant legal, regulatory, Executive Orders, directives, policies or standards as appropriate for business needs.


## Policy statements
Secure engineering principles shall be established, procedures documented and security requirements applied by design to in-house systems and activities whilst balancing the needs for information security against the need for business functionality, performance, accessibility and associated risks.
1. New systems and technologies shall be assessed for security risks and the design reviewed to protect against known attack vectors, patterns and threat actors;
2. The company shall commit to securing the use and deployment of IT systems within the corporate operating environment and systems boundaries;
3. System documentation, which may contain a range of sensitive information, i.e. descriptions of applications, processes, procedures, system setup and configurations, authorisation processes, etc., must be protected from unauthorised access, alteration, viewing or destruction, and classified according to the Information Classification Policy;
4. Hardware, systems, software and applications used in the conduct of business operations shall be recorded in an inventory of assets;
