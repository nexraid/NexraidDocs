# Nexraid Network Security Policy
## Introduction
The security of Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd (Nexraid) networks, systems and technology infrastructure is of vital operational importance in order to maintain the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of business operations thereby preserving the corporate reputation, brand and market credibility, whilst ensuring that only appropriately authorised and approved activities are conducted on those systems.


## Scope of Document
The scope of this Policy covers all corporate networking devices and services to safeguard and protect the corporate networks and supporting infrastructure. It also incorporates the secure management of networks which may span organisational boundaries and requires consideration of data flows, legal and regulatory obligations, monitoring and protection. Additional controls may be necessary to protect sensitive information passing over public networks.


## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide the requirements for connecting to the network and the use of the network services within the corporate infrastructure. 


## Network Security
1. The company shall develop, document and implement network configurations, security controls, and operational procedures in accordance with business justification and regulatory requirements, and subject them to risk assessment and vulnerability testing;
2. Network diagrams shall be produced and kept up-to-date; they are to identify all networks, network devices, system components and connections to the corporate network, sensitive network segments including any wireless networks.
3. Business justifications shall identify the services, protocols, ports and security features that are to be implemented for any device and/or interconnection on the network infrastructure;
4. The company’s networks shall be adequately managed and controlled in order to protect them from known and emerging (new) threats and vulnerabilities, i.e. interception, copying, modification, misrouting, destruction and to maintain the security and integrity of systems and applications across the network including information at rest in transit;
5. All ‘high risk’ and ‘critical’ vulnerabilities are to be assigned a business risk ranking that is based on industry best practices for consideration of the potential business impact;
6. Network diagram(s) shall be maintained that include an overlay to map sensitive data (including cardholder, PII and business sensitive data flows) and connections to other networks, including third party and wireless networks, such that appropriate controls and usage restrictions can be implemented;
7. Third party network connections must be documented and must define the interface characteristics, security requirements and nature of the information to be communicated through it and undergo an information security risk assessment prior to opening the network connection for data transfers;
8. Only connections from business information systems, as defined by its security boundary, that have been appropriately authorised through risk assessment shall be permitted;
9. Vendor defaults and other security parameters are to be changed before any systems are employed in an operational environment;
10. The business information systems shall uniquely identify and authenticate all requests for establishing connections from any local, remote or network device, application, process or user;
11. Information flow controls shall be applied using explicit security attributes on the information, source and destination as a basis for determining flow control decisions;
12. Network managers shall establish appropriate controls to protect data in the networks, the protection of connected services from unauthorised access through effective patch management, intrusion detection systems, virus prevention and access controls;
13. Production systems and networks must be both physically and logically separated from test and development systems;
14. A consistent set of network management processes and procedures maintained in accordance with corporate document control procedures shall be applied across all corporate networks and infrastructure;
15. Responsibilities and procedures for the management of remote equipment shall be established and maintained;
16. Formal agreements shall be established and documented in an ISA for interconnection of networks and the exchange of information, or software between the company and any third party;
17. Special controls based on a formal risk assessment process must be established, to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public networks and connected systems;
18. Security gateways can be used to validate source and destination addresses at internal and external network control points where proxy and/or network address translation technologies are employed;
19. Computer and network management activities shall be closely coordinated to optimise the service to the business and make certain that security measures are consistently applied; 
20. Groups of systems, i.e. for PCI DSS compliance, must be segregated to divide them into separate logical network domains (sub-networks) with separate physical network interfaces. A graduated set of controls can be applied to different domains to further segregate the network security environments. Such segregation is to be defined by risk assessment, which must meet design goals of defence-in-depth and enclave architecture;
21. Any changes to the network must be in line with the Change Management Policy and be documented and authorised through the Change Request Approval Process;
22. An inventory of network assets (systems components), that includes a description or function/use for each, shall be maintained and periodically reviewed (at least bi-annually or after any major technology refresh or systems upgrades) to verify that it accurately reflects deployed system components;
23. Cables / patching sockets shall be correctly labelled/documented and identified;
24. Computing platforms (i.e. servers, consoles, workstations, etc.) and network infrastructure elements (i.e. routers, switches, firewalls, etc.) connected to the network shall be configured as per the individual requirements of their hardening standard; (such as Centre for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks or similar guides:
25. Power and telecommunications cabling carrying data or supporting information services shall be afforded appropriate protection from unauthorised access, interception or damage;
26. Access to all publicly accessible network jacks shall be restricted.


## Firewalls, Routers & Switches
1. The company’s networks shall be protected throughout the systems life-cycle through the use of firewalls, proxy servers and other appropriate prevention systems at the network boundaries and at strategic internal network points as appropriate to the risks;
2. There shall be a firewall at each Internet connection and between any demilitarized zone (DMZ) and internal networks;
3. Firewall and router configurations are to only permit inbound and outbound traffic necessary for defined business purposes;
4. Network security devices shall be configured to follow a ‘least privilege’ policy on all inbound and outbound traffic, such that any network traffic that is not explicitly allowed shall be explicitly denied (‘deny all’) unless a specific allow statement has been authorised;
5. Firewalls, routers, switches are to be hardened using Centre for Internet Security benchmarks or similar guides, such that minimum services are running and file system security is locked down;
6. Firewall and router configuration standards are to include a documented list of all services, protocols and ports employed along with a business justification for their use;
7. There shall be a formal, verifiable process for testing and approving all network connections and changes to firewall and router configurations and rule-sets;
8. Firewall and router rule-sets shall be formerly reviewed and verified at least every six months; a record of such reviews is to be maintained for audit purposes.


## Redundancy
1. Network security devices shall be deployed with a ‘fail safe’ configuration such that if the appliance fails, and in the absence of any failover / high availability infrastructure, all network access shall be blocked, dropped and/or denied;
2. Where practical and possible all hardware platforms and software running on them shall be maintained at current, supported and replaceable version levels with up-to-date security patches applied;
3. Appropriate fall-back arrangements shall be established for each network service;
4. Network equipment shall be protected as appropriate against natural hazards, power failure and unauthorised access.
 

## Access
1. Physical access to critical networking areas (i.e. Computer rooms) and equipment shall be controlled and restricted in compliance with the Physical Security Policy;
2. Applications, systems and users shall be provided with logical access only to the services they have been specifically authorised to use;
3. Users wishing to access systems, services or components within the corporate network are required to authenticate themselves to the network. Remote access will incorporate two-factor authentication mechanisms;
4. Security and access control mechanisms that segregate networks into logical domains shall be employed;
5. Where third parties support and maintain any elements of the corporate systems and infrastructure, suitable contractual arrangements shall be in place to specify the level of compliance to any legal or regulatory requirements (i.e. PCI DSS, DPA, GDPR) and that all access from external information systems that process, store or transmit company controlled information has the minimum privileges necessary and appropriate for the associated and approved functionality;
6. Only approved and documented remote access methods will be permitted;
7. Third-party and remote access sessions to corporate systems shall be required to automatically disconnect after a period of inactivity not to exceed 15 minutes;
8. Third-party access to the corporate networks and systems shall be regularly reviewed.
9. Remote-access technologies used by vendors and business partners will only be activated when needed (where possible) and will be deactivated when not required for use;
10. Employ Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to provide encrypted data links where there is a requirement for a corporate system or network to communicate with a remote network or system and where that communications channel traverses a public network or a third party private network;
11. Access to corporate networks, applications and systems shall be revoked within one business day for employees terminating their employment with the company or for third party suppliers ceasing to require access.
12. The encryption level of remote access should be in line with the current best practices. At the time of writing, only SSHv2 is to be used;


## Network Logging, Monitoring & Auditing
1. Corporate networks shall incorporate tools (software and hardware based) for real-time monitoring, measuring and reporting of network connections and performance to verify the enforcement of security controls and systems configurations. Any deviations are to be reported through appropriate channels in order that they can be investigated and resolved without any undue delay;
2. The use of network resources shall be monitored, tuned and used for making projections on future capacity requirements to maintain system performance for business operations;
3. Monitoring systems shall be capable of immediately providing at least three months of data for review with a minimum of one year availability off-line;
4. Network security reviews shall be scheduled to identify any risks that may arise over time and confirm that agreed levels of service and control are adhered to;
5. Technical reviews shall take place after any changes to critical network infrastructure components so that there is no adverse impact upon the organisations business operations or security posture;
6. Upon detection of any event affecting the security of the corporate network, reporting and escalation actions in accordance with the Incident Response Management Policy shall be taken.


## Technical Testing
The following technical security testing shall be conducted:
1. There shall be a formal process to test and approve all: 
   1. network connections
   2. firewall and router configurations
