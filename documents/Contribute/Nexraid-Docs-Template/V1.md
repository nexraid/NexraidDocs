# Template for Nexraid Document

## Top Meta Fields

### `draft`

the article will not be published if this value is `true`. (like this document)

### `path` (**IMPORTANT!**)

1. this field is optional, the URL of the document will be generated from markdown file path automatically if it is unset.
2. This value must be starts with `/`, (Correct sample: `/private/template`. Incorrect: ~private/template~)

### `additional_path`
Alternate path to the URL to the document.


### `title`, `description`

title and description

### `keywords`

a keywords/tags array

### `sidebar`

Sidebar's name. this name must be defined in the directory `src/data/sidebar` of the repo **Gatsby Docs Template**

### `date`

When was this article created. (Eg. `2019-10-24`, `2019-10-24 05:19:20`)

### `version_date`, `version_name`, `version_changelog`

These fields are used for versioning control.

**Tips**: `version_date` can be different with `date`.
The value of `version_date` would be shown in the changelog section.
And the value of `date` would be shown in front of the article.

### Other custom fields

You can define other fields. 
But they won't affect the display of the document. 
So you can define some fields for editor only. For example: `todo: Finish the help section before this weekend`.

## Lists
```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   * Unordered sub-list L1
      * Unordered sub-list L2
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list L1
      1. Ordered sub-list L2
4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

<!-- This comment is used for separating close lists -->

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Links
```
[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links, such as <http://www.example.com>

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>&#096;&#096;&#096;</code> or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
```
</code></pre>



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

## Tables
Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
|---------------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
_Still_ | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Blockquotes
```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML
You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <b>tags</b>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <b>tags</b>.</dd>
</dl>


## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more hyphens

## Line Breaks
My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...  
This line is only separated by a single newline and 2 trailing spaces, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

YouTube Videos
They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:
```
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="480" height="360" border="10" /></a>
```

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=XqZsoesa55w
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/XqZsoesa55w/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>


Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
```
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```
