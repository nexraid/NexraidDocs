# Privacy and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Protection Policy

## Introduction
The PII that NEXRAID processes to provide these services relates to its clients (hybrid cloud service customers). This policy sets out NEXRAID’s commitment to ensuring that PII, which NEXRAID process as a cloud provider, is carried out in compliance in accordance with ISO 27701:2019 requirements and applicable client contractual terms. NEXRAID ensures that good PII protection practices are imbedded in the culture of our staff and our organisation.

## Scope
This document sets out the policy applies and to all PII processed by NEXRAID and is part of NEXRAID’s approach to compliance with applicable client contractual terms and ISO 27701:2019 requirements. All NEXRAID staff are expected to comply with this policy and failure to comply may lead to disciplinary action for misconduct, including dismissal.

## PII Protection Principles
1. NEXRAID complies with the PII protection principles set out below. When processing PII, it ensures that:
   1. it is processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);
   2. it is collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
   3. it is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);
   4. it is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date and that reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
   5. it is kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed (‘storage limitation’); and
   6. it is processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’);
2. NEXRAID will facilitate any request from a data subject/PII principal (natural person to whom PII relates) who wishes to exercise their rights under data protection law as appropriate, always communicating in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form and without undue delay.


## PII protection processes and procedures
1. NEXRAID will ensure that through management commitment, continual staff training and awareness including monitoring of compliance:
   1. ensure that the legal basis for processing PII is identified in advance and that all processing complies with the law;
   2. ensure that appropriate privacy notices are in place advising clients how and why their PII is being processed, and, in particular, advising data subjects of their rights;
   3. only collect and process the personal data that it needs for purposes it has identified in advance;
   4. ensure that, as far as possible, the PII it holds is accurate, or a system is in place for ensuring that it is kept up to date as far as possible;
   5. only hold onto your PII for as long as it is needed based on client contractual agreement terms, after which time NEXRAID will securely erase or delete the PII – NEXRAID’s data retention policy sets out the appropriate period of time; and
   6. ensure that appropriate information and PII security measures are in place to ensure that PII can only be accessed by those who need to access it and that it is held and transferred securely;
2. NEXRAID will ensure that all staff who are assigned and handles PII are aware of their responsibilities under this policy and relevant client contractual terms, data protection and information security policies, and that they are adequately trained and supervised. Breaching this policy may result in disciplinary action for misconduct, including dismissal. As obtaining (including accessing) or disclosing personal data in breach of NEXRAID’s data protection policies may also be a criminal offence, we may lodge a report with the relevant authorities (e.g., Singapore Police Force, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, Personal Data Protection Commission) as required.


## Data Subject / PII Principal Rights
1. NEXRAID has processes in place to ensure that it can facilitate any request made by an individual to exercise their rights under applicable data protection law and related client contractual terms. All staff have received training and are aware of the rights of data subjects/PII principal. Staff can identify such a request and know who to send it to. All requests will be considered without undue delay and will be fulfilled within one month of receipt as far as possible.

### Data Subject / PII Principal Access
1. the right to request information about how PII is being processed, including whether PII is being processed and the right to be allowed access to that PII and to be provided with a copy of that PII along with the right to obtain the following information:
   * the purpose of the processing;
   * the categories of personal data (name, phone number, email etc.);
   * the recipients to whom PII have been disclosed or which will be disclosed;
   * the retention period;
   * the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authorities (e.g., PDPC);
   * the source of the information if not collected direct from the data subject; and
   * the existence of any automated decision making.

### Rectification
the right to allow a data subject to rectify inaccurate personal data concerning them.

### Erasure
the right to have data erased and to have confirmation of erasure, but only where:
   * the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;
   * where consent is withdrawn;
   * where there is no legal basis for the processing; or
   * there is a legal obligation to delete data;

### Restriction of processing
the right to ask for certain processing to be restricted in the following circumstances, if:
   * the accuracy of the personal data is being contested;
   * our processing is unlawful, but the data subject does not want it erased;
   * the data is no longer needed for the purpose of the processing, but it is required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims; or
   * the data subject has objected to the processing, pending verification of that objection.

### Data portability
the right to receive a copy of personal data which has been provided by the data subject and which is processed by automated means in a format which will allow the individual to transfer the data to another data controller or processor. This would only apply if NEXRAID was processing the data using consent or on the basis of a contract.

### Object to processing
the right to object to the processing of personal data relying on the legitimate interests processing condition unless NEXRAID can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
