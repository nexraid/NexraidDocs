# Nexraid Information Security Policy 23 – Data Protection Impact Assessments

## Document Details
* Doc ID: ISP23
* Doc Title: Data Protection Impact Assessments
* Revision: 1.0
* Effective Date: 1 September 2022
* Last Review Date: 19 August 2022
* Author: Danny Tan
* Approver: Liu Lung Hao


## Conduct of DPIA 
Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) can be conducted on systems (e.g. public-facing websites, cloud storage platforms, Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") systems) and processes (e.g. undergoing a health screening and receiving the medical report, purchasing an item from an online portal and receiving it from a courier)

## When to Conduct a DPIA?
Data protection risks are best addressed when the system or process is
1. new and in the process of being designed; or
2. in the process of undergoing major changes. Introducing changes to address data protection risks after the design of a process or system has been finalised or implemented will likely lead to increased cost and effort. Some examples of when to conduct a DPIA include:
    1. Creating a new system that involves the handling of personal data (e.g. new website that collects personal data) 
    2. Creating a new process, including manual processes, that involves the handling of personal data (e.g. receptionist collecting personal data from visitors) 
    3. Changing the way that existing systems or processes handle personal data (e.g. redesign of the customer registration process) 
    4. Changes to the organisational structure that affects the department handling personal data (e.g. mergers and acquisition, restructuring) 5 Collecting new types of personal data (e.g. collecting new information about existing customers)


## DPIA Role and Responsibilities

### Project Manager or Equivalent
#### Role
* Person in charge of the project
#### Responsibilities
* DPIA lead, overall in-charge of the DPIA and could be supported by a DPIA team
* Assesses the need for DPIA, plans the DPIA and conducts the DPIA
* Identifies and seeks input from relevant stakeholders, including project team, on:
    * Potential data protection risks and challenges to the project from an implementation perspective
    * How identified personal data protection risks should be addressed and possible solutions
    * Documents DPIA report (which includes proposing detailed action plan) for management’s approval
    * Monitors DPIA outcomes and reviews the DPIA when there is a change in risks to personal data protection

### Data Protection Officer ("DPO")
#### Role
* Person responsible for creating and enforcing the Data Protection policies within the organisation May tap on DPO networks or associations for resources or advice from other DPOs to guide the DPIA lead in carrying out the DPIA.
#### Responsibilities
* Advises DPIA lead throughout the DPIA process, including: 
    * Identifying and mitigating identified data protection risks by providing support based on best practices adapted to organisation’s needs and circumstances 
    * Defining and applying the risk assessment framework 
    * Ensuring that DPIAs are conducted according to the organisation’s policies and recommends improvement to DPIA methodology based on industry best practices 
    * Reviewing DPIA report prior to submission to management • Develops the templates/DPIA questionnaire necessary to complete the DPIA 
* Assists in reviewing the DPIA when there is a change in risks to personal data protection

### Project Steering Committee or equivalent
#### Role
* Management of organisation that approved the project
#### Responsibilities
* Commissions the DPIA
* Approves the risk assessment framework
* Approves the DPIA plan, and proposed action plans and solutions arising from the DPIA

### Others
#### Role
* Other organisational functions or departments that have some level of involvement in the project, external parties such as subject matter experts or even potentially affected individuals, where needed.
#### Responsibilities
* Provides input on potential risks and challenges to the project with respect to their function. For example:
    * IT and Legal: Advising the DPIA lead on possible IT solutions and security/legal risks in implementing measures to protect personal data. This may also include advising on potential challenges on system design and development.
 * Customer Service, Communications or Operations: Advising the DPIA lead on possible consumer impact (e.g. in terms of usability) if the DPIA outcomes warrant a change to consumer interaction or day-to-day operations.
    * Human Resource or Staff Capability: Advising on the appropriate training programmes or resources should the DPIA outcomes require staff to be able to carry out new data protection measures or activities.


## Phases of DPIA Life Cycle 
DPIA life cycle consists of six phases namely:

### Phase 1 – Assess Need for DPIA
DPIA Lead and DPO to conduct an assessment if there is a need for a DPIA by determining if the project involves personal data (i.e. the collection, use, transfer, disclosure or storage of personal data). If the project does not involve personal data, then a DPIA is not necessary along with the following typical questions:
1. Is a new system or process being introduced, developed or implemented? For example, new IT systems or manual processes that involve the handling of personal data (e.g. receptionist collecting personal data from visitors, disposal of physical documents containing personal data, submitting of physical medical claims). 
2. Is an existing system or process being reviewed or substantially redesigned? For example, a redesign of an operational process workflow that involves different groups of users handling personal data. 
3. Is the organisation starting to collect new types of data? For example, a change of business model which may include collecting new types of personal data about existing customers.

### Phase 2 – Plan for DPIA
In establishing the key activities or steps needed to conduct the DPIA, the DPIA lead should cover the following aspects:
1. Project description — An overview of the project (e.g. objective/background, organisation department/functions involved, timeline), why a DPIA is needed and key considerations surrounding the DPIA, if any
2. Scope of DPIA — Describe in detail the specific system or process on which a DPIA needs to be carried out.
3. Define risk assessment framework or methodology — This includes establishing the risk assessment criteria and methods of calculating risk
4. Parties involved — Identify relevant internal departments/ functions or external stakeholders (e.g. subject matter experts, consultants, regulatory authorities or customers) whose inputs or views would have to be sought during consultation or interview sessions, and describe how their views would be sought
5. DPIA timeline — Provide an estimate of the time required for key tasks and overall timeline for conducting the DPIA.

### Phase 3 – Identify Data and Personal Data Flows
DPIA lead should also consult with the project team and relevant departments or functions to ensure comprehensiveness and accuracy of personal data involved in the project on the collection, use and disclosure including:
1. Identify various types of personal data handled (or envisaged to be handled) in relation to the specific project and determine the organisation’s purposes for collecting, using or disclosing them; and
2. Map the way that personal data flows through various stages or touchpoints of the project (e.g. considering operational workflows or business processes), across its life cycle (i.e. from collection to storage and/or disposal).

### Phase 4 – Identify and Assess Data Protection Risks 
DPIA lead to identify and assess personal data protection risks by adopting 
ISMSP 05 Risk Methodology:
1. Completing a DPIA questionnaire to assess the project against PDPA requirements and/or data protection best practices;
2. Identifying areas in the personal data flow which could lead to a breach of the PDPA (e.g. loss of personal data) or are gaps when compared against industry best practices; and
3. Analysing the potential impact and likelihood of identified gaps and risks based on the pre-defined risk framework.
Phase 5 – Create Action Plan 
DPIA lead to propose how the identified data protection risks should be addressed as follows:
1. Documented in the form of an action plan, 
2. Indicate the action owner(s) responsible for the implementation of specific recommendations (such as technical or organisational measures), and 
3. Monitoring of implementation outcomes, as well as implementation timelines.

### Phase 6 – Implement and Monitor Action Plan 
DPIA lead to document the whole DPIA process (i.e. how the DPIA was scoped, planned and carried out, findings and proposed action plan) into a DPIA report for reviewed by DPO and seek approval from Project Steering Committee/or equivalent to implement the action plan.

## Monitoring and Review
This policy shall be regularly monitored and reviewed, at least once every year or when there is DPIA conducted.
