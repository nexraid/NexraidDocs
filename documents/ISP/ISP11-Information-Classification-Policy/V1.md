# Nexraid Information Classification Policy
## Introduction
Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd (Nexraid) processes information relating to its clients’ confidential and personal information relating to its business operations. A proportion of this information is business sensitive and consequentially appropriate security controls and measures need to be applied to safeguard the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of that data.


## Scope of Document
The scope of this policy applies to all information (data), within operational systems as well as that in temporary, backup and archive that is created, stored or processed by Nexraid and includes information held in electronic or hard-copy/paper formats and by its nature may also determine what can be communicated verbally to third parties.


## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to ensure that information assets receive a level of protection commensurate with the risks associated with the potential damage that can be caused to the Nexraid brand through its misuse.
An information classification scheme shall be used to indicate the need and priority for security protection so that:
   1. The appropriate level of sensitivity of information is recognised;
   2. The appropriate method of handling and storing the information is identified and information is protected accordingly;
   3. Employees are aware of different sensitivity levels and can apply appropriate controls to the information they process in the course of their business activities
   4. Information is retained, handled and processed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, Directives, policies and business operational requirements.


## Information Protection
Information is an invaluable business asset. By its very nature some information processed, stored and transmitted internally and externally of Nexraid is sensitive and consequently requires suitable protection to safeguard it from unauthorised access, manipulation, disclosure or destruction. An information protective marking scheme shall be used to indicate the need and priority for security protection so that:

1. The appropriate level of sensitivity of information is recognised;
2. The appropriate method of handling and storing the information is identified and applied;
3. Employees are aware of different sensitivity levels and can apply appropriate controls to the information they process in the course of their business activities
4. Information is retained, handled and processed in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, Directives, policies and business operational requirements.


## Classification General Requirements
1. Information is to be protected (classified) according to its business and personal sensitivity, i.e. the potential harm to the business or individual if the information were to be compromised in any way.
2. Departments need to determine which information requires additional protection, the appropriate controls and level of ‘Classification’ to be applied. Thereafter the information, in whatever form it takes must be labelled and handled according to its classification type; unless the information owner determines that the Classification level can be lowered. This must incorporate the protection of temporary or permanent copies including that held in backup and archive
3. Employees must consult with line managers if there is any potential issue regarding classification or if there is uncertainty which classification to use. Managers may consult with the Information Security Committee if they require assistance with the identification of the appropriate classification level.
4. The classification of information can change over time; generally, as information becomes outdated it becomes less sensitive. The Information Security Committee can lower the classification level in consultation with the author when it is no longer deemed to be appropriate.
5. Important business records and papers (hard copy materials) shall be afforded appropriate levels of protection and control to prevent their loss, unauthorised destruction, falsification, dissemination and access in accordance with statutory, regulatory, contractual or business requirements.
6. Care must be taken when assigning the appropriate classification, ’Over-classifying’ will result in unnecessary controls being applied to information that is not very sensitive, but ’under-classifying’ can lead to sensitive information being compromised.


## Information Security Aspects
1. To apply the policies and standards consistently across the company, information systems and data contained therein shall be classified according to the business purpose of the system and the impact that breaches in confidentiality, availability and integrity would have on the business should they occur.
2. Criteria forming the basis for determining the security and access requirements for information assets are:
   * Confidentiality (C): the information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes
   * Integrity (I): The information is current, complete and only authorised and accurate changes are made to it
   * Availability (A): That the information is presented to authorised users upon demand
   * Value (V): intellectual property and value to the business or an individual
3. The levels of security classification within the company are defined in the following sections.
4. Appendix 1 provides a description of the controls to be applied to the classification levels and different methods by which each may be processed in the conduct of business activities.

## Security Classification Tags
