   2. to third party service providers, agents and other organisations we have engaged to perform any of the functions with reference to the above mentioned purposes.
4. The purposes listed in the above clauses may continue to apply even in situations where your relationship with us (for example, pursuant to a contract) has been terminated or altered in any way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable us to enforce our rights under any contract with you).


## Deemed Consent by Notification
1. We may collect or use your personal data, or disclose existing personal data for secondary purposes that differ from the primary purpose which it had originally collected for pursuant to clauses stated in "Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Data". If Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd intends to rely on deemed consent by notification for such secondary purposes, Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd will notify you of the proposed collection, use or disclosure of his personal data through appropriate mode(s) of communication.

   1. To verify your identity and materials provided
   2. To conduct security clearance for high security or sensitive projects
   3. To contact you in the event that a suitable role is available for you.
3. Before relying on deemed consent by notification, Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd will assess and determine that the collection, use and disclosure of the personal data will not likely have an adverse effect on you.
4. You will be given a reasonable period to inform us if you wish to opt-out of the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data for such purposes.
