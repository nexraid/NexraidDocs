We shall seek your consent before collecting any additional personal data and before using your personal data for a purpose which has not been notified to you (except where permitted or authorised by law).
2. We may collect and use your personal data for any or all of the following purposes:
   1. performing obligations in the course of or in connection with our provision of the goods and/or services requested by you;

4. The purposes listed in the above clauses may continue to apply even in situations where your relationship with us (for example, pursuant to a contract) has been terminated or altered in any way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable us to enforce our rights under any contract with you).
5. By providing personal data related to a third party (e.g. spouse, children, parents, referees and/or employees), the individual shall represent and warrant that prior consent is obtained from such third party for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data.

2. In particular, we may rely on deemed consent by notification to collect, use or disclose your personal data for the following purposes:
   1. To verify your identity and materials provided
   2. To conduct security clearance for high security or sensitive projects
3. Before relying on deemed consent by notification, Nexraid Consulting Pte Ltd will assess and determine that the collection, use and disclosure of the personal data will not likely have an adverse effect on you.
4. You will be given a reasonable period to inform us if you wish to opt-out of the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data for such purposes.
5. After the lapse of the opt-out period, you may notify us that you no longer wish to consent to the purposes for which your consent was deemed by notification by withdrawing your consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal data in relation to those purposes.
